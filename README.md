# food_calorie
Little project for an internship

Takes images as inputs and detects the food in it. Then estimates the calorie intake.
Example food images in the 'food' file.

Uses TensorFlow's Keras for image detection, and Watsonx AI via LangChain for calorie estimates.

Run pl.py with 
```bash:bash
streamlit run pl.py
```
